State emissions and enrichments tab – The first column gives a color and number for each mixture. The second column gives the mixture mnemonic. The third column gives a number to each individual state of the mixture. The next 12 columns give the emission probabilities for each chromatin mark as indicated. The next two columns gives the maximum and minimum emission probabilities represented as percentages. The next column gives the enrichment of the individual states for annotated TSS. Individual states within each mixture are ordered in decreasing value of this enrichment. The next column gives the initial probability of starting in the state overall. The last column gives the initial probability of the state given the mixture.

Transition Probabilities tab – This tab shows the transition probability indicating the probability when in the state of the row of transitioning to the state of the column. Probabilities are shown for individual states of the model which are ordered and colored based on the mixture to which they belong as indicated.
