# ChromGene
Gene-Based Modelling of Epigenomic Data

ChromGene is a method for annotating genomic intervals by modeling them as arising from a mixture of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). As with a Gaussian Mixture Model, where each point is assumed to have been generated by exactly one Gaussian distribution, each gene is assumed to be generated by exactly one HMM. Each HMM is fully-connected, and is defined by emission parameters of each of S states, the transition parameters between them, and the prior probabilities of each state.

We applied ChromGene to a set of 19,919 protein-coding genes across 127 imputed epigenomes (Frankish et al. 2018, Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al. 2015). The full set of annotations is reported in this repository, and their descriptions and various metrics are reported at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEkR6ivDbrmtxEnm7Jf7H2Etx_-p8C3KSxAA3btHRnY/edit?usp=sharing. Along with the annotations, we have included code to generate input files on top of ChromHMM (Ernst and Kellis, 2015), the main and supplementary figures, and jupyter notebooks used to generate figures.

ChromGene can be applied to any genomic intervals where histone marks and DNA accessibility tracks are expected to vary across the genome by modifying the provided code.
